###  Comments
#### HTML Rules Broken:

1. No or bad indentation is done making the code unreadable.
2. The main headings are of the section are smaller than it's content.
3. There are inline elements containing block elements such as paragraph tag containing the a tag "< a >< p >< /p >< /a >"."
4. Unnecessary spacing has broken some of the tags which are covering more content then they are supposed to like the < /a> on Authors in line 1 of the footer and </ a> on the last line.
5. There are multiple borken hyperlinks which lead to no specific website which are scattered in unconventional locations.
6. There are unnecessary empty list items in the un-ordered list.
7. Words are concatenated in places making it difficult to read the content.
8. The font and color of the content makes it even more uncomprehendable when read with the background images used.

#### Material Studied

* Recorded Lectures & ZyBooks from CSCI-1170

### Comments

#### Worked on Section Menu
1. I break the < li >< ul >< ol > rules, under the normal case, we need put < li >'s below < ol > or < ul > but in my code, I didn't follow the rules.
2. In the pictures, I didn't set picture size, so all the pictures have different size, and the last one I used didn't show anything.

#### Why I Break Thoses Rules
I want to make the website looks mess, like I build number list under the point list, I insert pictures with different so it will make the website looks mess, then it will be worse.

## Working on:

#### Section ID "greenborder"

Chose the color for border that does not have uniformity to the background. 

#### Background

Applied a messy background that lead content to become difficult to view.

#### Section ID "welcome"

1. In addition to the messy background, choose the font and color for word that not easily to view.
2. Also choose the color and font for word that do not have uniformity to the background.
3. Add the link to a web that refused to connect, leave a big grey block on the webpage.
4. Apply the "marquee" tags that not belong to the valid html commend anymore, to let the word scroll to different direction in different speed that brings more chaos.
5. Using the tag < b > that is not formally used in html language,should use < strong >.
